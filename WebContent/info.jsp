                        Has your Local Education Agency (LEA) embarked on creating Student Learning Objectives (SLOs) only to find some major validity concerns?  Have you been asked by a first grade art teacher and a senior physics teacher, "How do I create growth targets?" only to respond with a "dear in the headlights" stare?  Have you come to the realization that you do not have high quality pre and post assessments in your LEA, aligned to one another in what is being measured, at what frequency and at what level of cognitive difficulty?  Has it occurred to you that you probably don't have any mechanisms to control for the difficulty of your pre and post assessment?  Without such a solution, when a teacher submits their pre and post data, you are simply performing a simple subtraction problem to indicate growth, the pre and the post scores have no real meaning or correlation between them, they're just simply two numbers.  That SLO scenario yields almost nothing that accurately indicates student growth.  Whew!  Are you feeling overwhelmed along with 600 plus LEAs in Ohio, untrained to implement this work and when you're taking the advice of contacting your local assessment expert, you find that "nobody's home?"

                        Well then hi, we're Pinpoint Growth.  We have designed an integrated curriculum, assessment and statistical framework to assist your LEA in providing more valid, consistent and statistically reliable SLOs.  Through an integrated approach of professional development with your staff and user-friendly web-based tools, we will provide your LEA with high quality assessment literacy and the ability to prove student growth on par with any growth model we have seen in any state that has embarked on the SLO endeavor.  Through a method that quantifies rubric-based growth for performance assessment and using criterion-referenced scoring for traditional testing methods, we are working to eliminate the issue of growth targets simply being a "shot in the dark" and current models of pre and post scores being nearly meaningless, simple, uncorrelated subtraction problems.  Bring us in for a conversation and an opportunity to show you our exciting work.  We think we'll change your attitude towards SLOs from, "These SLOs are going to be a nightmare" to "Huh, now that made sense, I actually like that."  We have received genuinely positive feedback from teachers who have worked with our assessment concepts and used our web-based tools and are confident you will find our system to be good for both students and teachers in your LEA.
